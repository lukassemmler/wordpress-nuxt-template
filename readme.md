# docker-wordpress-test

* The goal is to run Wordpress as Headless CMS (backend) and use Nuxt as frontend.
* To make things more manageable, we use Docker to containerize the backend (Wordpress), frontend (Nuxt) and database (MySQL).


## Inspiration 

* Wordpress is one of the most popular CMS systems in the world
* But personally, I hate developing anything for it. The API is a convoluted mess.
* So the idea is to run Wordpress as Headless CMS, so the backend (content management) is separated from the frontend (presentation).
* Wordpress offers a REST API, so we can use any frontend technology that can consume that API.
* In this case I opted for Nuxt, because I like the opinionated approach with Vue components and the project structure.
* The project structure itself is based on "Hands-on Nuxt.js Web Development" (see [Appendix](#appendix)).
* Also I wanted to learn about Docker, because installing development servers and databases always was such a hassle in the past.


## Technologies

### Wordpress (Backend)

* Admin user
  * Name: `admin`
  * Password: `password`
* We use https://wpackagist.org/ to load wordpress plugins and themes as composer packages.
* So to make sure to run `cd wordpress && composer install` first, before building composer images.


### Nuxt (Frontend)

* TODO

### Hands-on Nuxt.js Web Development

> ## Creating headless REST APIs in WordPress
> 
> WordPress (WordPress.org) is an open source PHP CMS for general-purpose website development. 
> It is not "headless" by default; it is stacked with a template system. 
> This means the view and the data are intertwined. 
> However, since 2015 (WordPress 4.4), the REST API infrastructure has been integrated into WordPress core for developers, and now
> all the default endpoints can be accessed if you append /wp-json/ to your website-based URL. 
> You can also extend the WordPress REST API and add your own custom endpoints. 
> So, we can easily use WordPress as a "headless" REST API by ignoring the view. 
> You will find out how to achieve this in the upcoming sections. 
> 
> To speed up the development process, we will install the following WordPress plugins:
> 
> 1. **Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)** for creating custom meta boxes. 
>    For more information about this plugin, please visit https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/.
> 2. **The ACF Repeater Field** for creating a repeatable set of subfields. 
>    It is an ACF premium add-on (https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/add-ons/).
>    You can purchase it from https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/add-ons/repeater-field/. 
>    Alternatively, you can get it by default from ACF PRO at https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro/.
> 3. **Rewrite Rules Inspector** for inspecting and flushing your rewrite rules in WordPress. 
>    For more information about this plugin, please visit https://wordpress.org/plugins/rewrite-rules-inspector/
> 
> You can create your own plugins and meta boxes if you prefer not to use any of these.
> Please check out how to create custom meta boxes at https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/metadata/custom-meta-boxes/. 
> Also, check out how to develop custom plugins at https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/.
